# Cognitive Workload Detection Using ML 

This project develops a machine learning pipeline to classify cognitive workload levels using eye-tracking data collected under various task conditions. Four classification models such as Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest, Logistic Regression, and Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) were implemented and compared across fixation, saccade, and combined normalized feature sets. The SVM model achieved the highest accuracy of 73.4%, followed by Random Forest at 68%, demonstrating robust performance. The analysis revealed that saccadic eye movements are stronger indicators of cognitive stress and task complexity compared to fixation features alone. Python libraries such as Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, and Seaborn were employed for data preprocessing, feature analysis, visualization, and model validation using five-fold cross-validation.
